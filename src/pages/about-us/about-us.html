        <h3>RMNCH+A Toolkit</h3>

        <p>The Reproductive Maternal Newborn Child and Adolescent Health (RMNCH+A) program is an important indicator of the
            overall functioning of the health care delivery system in the country. The program is an amalgamation of multiple
            interventions and a multitude of data is generated from various sources to track program implementation and progress.
            Due to the elaborate nature of the RMNCH+A program and the volume of data being generated, it often is difficult
            to collate and compile critical RMNCH+A indicators.</p>

        <p>The current toolkit offers a one stop solution to assessing RMNCH+A related statistics from different sources
            through a combination of approaches. Designed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare with support from
            USAID - VRIDDHI (Scaling up RMNCH+A Interventions) Project, the RMNCH+A Toolkit Application provides customized
            snapshots of important indicators pertaining to overall RMNCH+A Program and its respective themes.</p>

        <p>Data for more than 180 indicators from various secondary surveys like Census, Sample Registration System (SRS),
            National Family Health Survey (NFHS), District Level Household Survey (DLHS), Annual Health Survey (AHS),Health
            Management Information System (HMIS) and Supportive Supervision (SS) have been collated in the application and
            can be accessed via geographical locations (national, state and district levels) and via thematic areas.</p>

        <p>"RMNCH+A snapshot" module provides access to the 21 key performance indicators from recommended sources across
            the themes for any geographical location(natinal, state and district levels). The data snapshot can be accessed
            for individual themes as well based on selection. </p>

        <p>An "Aspirational District" module has been included to provide easy access to important indicators in a snapshot
            view. It is intended to ensure the regular tracking of aspirational districts so that rapid transformation can
            be done.</p>

        <p>"Comparative profile" module provides users option to visualize the comparative data for any indicator across
            three different geographical areas at any level e.g. national, state and district.</p>

        <p>“Data repository” view provides user the option to visualize the data of indicators as per source.Downloadable
            links to the survey data sets are also available in the application by "Factsheets".</p>

        <p>The application provides a visualization of data across timelines for each data source in line chart, bar chart,
            tabular format and map visualization across different geographies for snapshot view. </p>

        <p>The application aims to provide critical RMNCH+A information from across the country and is intended to help policy
            makers, program managers, implementers, academicians, researchers, health workers access and utilize available
            data for effective decision making.</p>
